see what we need to do.
first create a git hub account
than create a repository it mean a place wher we are writing code or storing code or project 
once we create the repository initiate it
it will create a automatically read.me file
then go for first commit
commit
'
now for second commit 
we are going to add something let us assume we want toadd something in this project like a new feature
ok so we have addded new feature
and now commiting with same master still not doing branching here we will see it next in 
now i am adding new step which i ll commit in branch not in master
..why suppose we are adding new feature in our existin code but we are not sure that that this code will function correctly or not sowe are saving in branch and we wll use branch concept.but remember onething we are writing code in master itself

branching
 done with branching as well finally
