see what we need to do.
first create a git hub account
than create a repository it mean a place wher we are writing code or storing code or project 
once we create the repository initiate it
it will create a automatically read.me file
then go for first commit
commit
'
now for second commit 
we are going to add something let us assume we want toadd something in this project like a new feature
ok so we have addded new feature
and now commiting with same master still not doing branching here we will see it next in 
now we are comleting our master page or we can say that version 1 completed 
finally done ready to deliver project..(but it will not reflect in branch )
